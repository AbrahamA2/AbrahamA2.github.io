			So, here's the situation. I have some frozen eggs in my freezer. Sounds like the start to terrible book, right? <br>
			That's what I thought too. The reason I have eggs in my freezer, however, is because they're not in your possession <br>

			So instead, I will upload the mighty eggs here, to commemorate them forever. (I have no autocorrect here, had to google how to spell komemeor8)<br>
