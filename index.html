<h1>I guess I should put a title here, right?</h1>
<p>
So, here's the situation. I have some frozen eggs in my freezer. Sounds like the start to terrible book, right? <br>
That's what I thought too. The reason I have eggs in my freezer, however, is because they're not in your possession <br>
they're supposed to be.. in your possession... <font size="1">oops</font><br>
So instead, I will upload the mighty eggs here, to commemorate them forever. (I have no autocorrect here, had to google how to spell komemeor8)<br>

<br>
<small>oh and your egg cracked, humpty dumpty style. It's still intact, though.</small>

<br> 
I love you, <br> 
Abraham. <br>
