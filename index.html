<h1>Hi Gaby, welcome to the gift that keeps on giving</h1>
<p>Welcome to your new place! It's kind of drab around here... over time things should start looking up. <br>
For now, enjoy these flowers I got you for our 6 month! ✾ ✿ ❀ ❁<br>
Just so you know, this isn't some website template, this thing is the labor of my love <br> 
Hard coded by hand using HTML and a domain name that belongs to you.<br> 
I'll be updating this every day, whether it be with poems, messages, fun facts, depends on the day <br><br>  

But today, I just want to tell you I love you so much. Hey, I like that.. that'll stay here. Lol <br> <br> 

I love you, <br> 
Abraham. <br>
